General ideas:
  We now have two ideas for this project: 
    1. game review site where shows the most recent game in different genre (rpg, fps, etc..). This site will provide IGN
       score of the specific game (if any), basic description of the game, recent news about the game, and ratings (optional)
    2. a site which can provide traveler necessary information when they are going to travel around. Information such as 
       weather, local food, local scenery, cost of the flight from users place to their destination, airbnb plug in, and so on.
