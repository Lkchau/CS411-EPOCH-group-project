# Project repo for group EPOCH CS411

We are Section A5 - Group 6

Note - The code for the API requirement is in the "project" folder.
The oauth for spotify is also contained within the same folder... It is handled mainly in the server.js file.

To run the program:

Clone the repo
CD into the directory where the repo was cloned
CD into "project\project\src"

put "node server.js" into the command line and this will run the back-end server on localhost:8888
Then in another terminal window, go into the same directory and run "npm start", this will pull up the front-end react project and run it on localhost:3000.
